# MINFLUX_analysis
This repo contains the code to analyze MINFLUX single molecule tracking data.

The code extracts single molecule tracks from numpy raw track data, overlays individual single molecule tracks on top of the confocal channel, categorizes tracks based on subcellular location and and analyzes the apparent and anomalous diffusion properties for each single molecule track.
